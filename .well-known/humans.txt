# PROJECT STATS

    Started: 2025-01-21
    Current Version: 0.1.0
    Lines of Code: ~18,000+
    Documentation: ~20,000+ words
    Examples: 17 programs
    Test Coverage: 40+ tests

# PHILOSOPHY

    "Code injection isn't prevented by careful programming -
     it's prevented by making it grammatically impossible to express."

    Named after Julia Robinson, mathematician who helped solve
    Hilbert's 10th problem. The "Viper" is a playful pun on "adder"
    (both a snake and a calculator).
