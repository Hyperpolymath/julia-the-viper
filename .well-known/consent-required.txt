# Consent Required - HTTP 430 Protocol
# Julia the Viper Project
# Last Updated: 2025-01-22

# This file implements the HTTP 430 "Consent Required" status code
# as part of ethical web standards and data sovereignty principles.

# Purpose:
# Indicate that certain operations require explicit user consent
# before proceeding, in accordance with privacy regulations
# (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) and ethical computing principles.

# Scope of Consent Requirements:
# 1. Data collection and processing
# 2. Third-party integrations
# 3. Telemetry and analytics
# 4. Cookie usage
# 5. AI training data usage

# Current Implementation:
# Julia the Viper is primarily a programming language tool that
# operates locally and offline-first. However, we respect consent
# principles for any future web services, package registries, or
# cloud offerings.

# Consent Categories:

## Category 1: Essential Operations
# Operations necessary for core functionality
# Examples: Parsing JtV code, running interpreter locally
# Consent: Implicit (required for tool to function)
# Data retention: Session-only (no persistence)

## Category 2: Optional Features
# Operations that enhance experience but aren't required
# Examples: Telemetry, crash reports, usage analytics
# Consent: Explicit opt-in required
# Data retention: As specified in privacy policy
# Current status: NOT IMPLEMENTED (no telemetry)

## Category 3: Third-Party Services
# Operations involving external services
# Examples: Package registry, WASM playground, cloud compilation
# Consent: Explicit opt-in required per service
# Data retention: Per service privacy policy
# Current status: NOT IMPLEMENTED (offline-first design)

# How to Provide Consent:

## Command-Line Interface
# Consent is requested via CLI prompts when applicable
# Example: jtv telemetry enable --consent
# Stored in: ~/.config/jtv/consent.toml

## Web Services (Future)
# Consent UI presented before data collection
# Stored in: Browser local storage
# Can be revoked at any time via settings

# Consent Management:

## View Current Consent Status
# CLI: jtv consent status
# Web: Settings → Privacy → Consent

## Revoke Consent
# CLI: jtv consent revoke --all
# Web: Settings → Privacy → Revoke Consent

## Export Consent History
# CLI: jtv consent export --format json
# Web: Settings → Privacy → Download Data

# Data Subject Rights:
# In accordance with GDPR Article 15-22, users have the right to:
# 1. Access their data (jtv data export)
# 2. Rectification (jtv data update)
# 3. Erasure (jtv data delete)
# 4. Portability (jtv data export --format json)
# 5. Object to processing (jtv consent revoke)
# 6. Not be subject to automated decision-making (N/A for JtV)

# Response time: 48 hours

# Legal Basis for Processing:
# - Legitimate interest: Core tool functionality
# - Consent: Optional features (when implemented)
# - Contract: Package registry usage (future)

# Data Protection Officer:
# Role: TBD (not yet required for current scale)
# Contact: dpo@julia-viper.dev (future)

# Last updated: 2025-01-22

# Implementation Status:
# ✅ Offline-first design (no consent needed for core functionality)
# ✅ No telemetry or analytics
# ✅ No third-party tracking
# ⏳ Future: Opt-in telemetry with explicit consent
# ⏳ Future: Package registry with terms of service

# Compliance:
# GDPR: Yes (privacy by design)
# CCPA: Yes (no sale of personal information)
# PIPEDA: Yes (Canadian privacy law)
# Other: Designed for global compliance

# Notes:
# This is a living document and will be updated as features evolve.
# Changes to consent requirements will be communicated via:
# - CHANGELOG.md entries
# - Release notes
# - Email notifications (if applicable)
# - In-app notifications (future)

# Philosophy:
# Julia the Viper is committed to data sovereignty, privacy, and
# user autonomy. We collect only what is necessary, with explicit
# consent, and delete when requested.
