# Julia the Viper - Development Roadmap

## Vision

JtV is a Harvard Architecture language that makes code injection **grammatically impossible** through separation of Control (Turing-complete) and Data (Total/provably halting) languages.

## Phase 0: Prove It Works (CRITICAL - Weeks 1-4)

**Goal**: Demonstrate that JtV solves real problems better than alternatives

### Week 1-2: WASM Compiler
- [ ] Implement code generation from AST to WASM
- [ ] Handle all 7 number systems in WASM output
- [ ] Optimize for size and performance
- [ ] Test with actual browser execution

### Week 3: Benchmarking & Validation
- [ ] Create benchmark suite comparing JtV vs Python/JS
- [ ] Target: 5-10x speedup for math-heavy pure functions
- [ ] Record video demo showing performance gains
- [ ] Document test methodology

### Week 4: Launch
- [ ] Write technical blog post explaining Harvard Architecture
- [ ] Submit to Hacker News, /r/programming
- [ ] Target: 500+ GitHub stars
- [ ] Collect feedback on smart contract use case

## Phase 1: Smart Contract Focus (Months 2-3)

**Rationale**: Unique differentiator, high value market, clearer ROI than Python optimization

### Month 2: Auditor Partnerships
- [ ] Contact 2-3 blockchain security firms
- [ ] Offer free JtV audits for their clients
- [ ] Gather case studies of bugs prevented
- [ ] Refine compiler based on real contracts

### Month 3: Ecosystem Building
- [ ] Solidity-to-JtV transpiler (for migration)
- [ ] Hardhat/Foundry integration
- [ ] Standard library for common patterns (ERC20, ERC721, etc.)
- [ ] Security analyzer for existing Solidity code

## Phase 2: Tooling & DX (Months 4-6)

### LSP Server
- Full IDE support (VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.)
- Real-time Totality checking
- Purity violation warnings
- Type inference

### Error Messages
- Friendly explanations for grammar violations
- Suggestions for converting imperative to JtV style
- "Did you mean?" suggestions

### Playground
- Web-based editor with Monaco
- Router Visualization (Control vs Data separation)
- Live execution traces
- Share snippets via URL

## Phase 3: Formal Verification (Months 7-9)

### Lean 4 Integration
- Automated proof generation for Totality
- Verify purity of @pure functions
- Prove absence of integer overflow
- Generate certificates for smart contracts

### Coq Backend (Stretch Goal)
- Alternative proof assistant support
- Export proofs for academic verification
- Integration with formal methods toolchains

## Phase 4: Production Readiness (Months 10-12)

### Compiler Optimizations
- Constant folding for Data expressions
- Loop unrolling with known bounds
- Dead code elimination
- SIMD optimization for number operations

### Debugger
- Step-through execution
- Variable inspection
- Time-travel debugging (leverage reversibility)
- Breakpoints in Control and Data contexts

### Package Manager
- JtV package registry
- Dependency resolution
- Semantic versioning
- Security advisories

## Success Metrics

### Phase 0 (Launch)
- 500+ GitHub stars
- 10+ blog posts/tweets from influencers
- 3+ companies expressing interest

### Phase 1 (Smart Contracts)
- 5+ production smart contracts using JtV
- 1+ major blockchain adopting JtV support
- 10+ documented CVEs prevented

### Phase 2 (Tooling)
- 1000+ active users
- 50+ community contributions
- LSP server in 3+ IDEs

### Phase 3 (Formal Verification)
- 100+ formally verified smart contracts
- 1+ academic paper accepted
- Cited in security audits

### Phase 4 (Production)
- $100M+ TVL in JtV smart contracts
- Enterprise support contracts
- Conference talks at Devcon, EthCC, etc.

## Critical Decisions

### Completed ✅
- Harvard Architecture as core design
- Addition-only in Data Language
- Rust for compiler (performance + safety)
- Pest for parsing (simplicity + speed)
- Smart contracts as primary market

### Pending ⏳
- Which blockchain to target first? (Ethereum? Cosmos? Solana?)
- Standalone VM or compile-to-existing? (WASM, EVM, etc.)
- Open source license strategy (GPL? MIT? Dual license?)
- Business model (OSS + enterprise support? SaaS?)

## Resources Required

### Week 1-4 (Phase 0)
- 1 senior Rust engineer (WASM compiler)
- 1 technical writer (documentation)
- Cloud hosting for playground ($100/mo)

### Month 2-6 (Phase 1-2)
- +1 blockchain engineer (smart contract expertise)
- +1 frontend engineer (playground/tooling)
- Marketing budget ($5k/mo)

### Month 7-12 (Phase 3-4)
- +1 formal methods expert (Lean/Coq)
- +1 DevRel engineer (community, docs, tutorials)
- Enterprise support infrastructure

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk: Performance claims unproven
- Mitigation: Week 3 dedicated to rigorous benchmarking
- Transparent methodology, open-source tests

### Risk: Smart contract market too niche
- Mitigation: Phase 0 validates market interest before deep investment
- Pivot to Python optimization if needed

### Risk: Formal verification too academic
- Mitigation: Focus on practical benefits (bug prevention, audit cost reduction)
- Partner with security firms for credibility

### Risk: Language adoption is slow
- Mitigation: Start with analyzer (works with existing code)
- Progressive migration path (annotate→extract→rewrite)

## Next Steps (This Week)

1. **Complete WASM backend** - Blocking everything else
2. **Run benchmarks** - Validate performance claims
3. **Record demo video** - Essential for launch
4. **Draft blog post** - Prepare launch materials
5. **Set up analytics** - Track adoption metrics
