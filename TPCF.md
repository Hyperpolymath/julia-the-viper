# Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF)

Julia the Viper implements the TPCF security model with three graduated trust perimeters.

## Overview

TPCF separates contribution surfaces by trust level:

1. **Perimeter 1 (Core)**: Maintainer-only, highest security
2. **Perimeter 2 (Trusted Contributors)**: Vetted contributors, moderate security
3. **Perimeter 3 (Community Sandbox)**: Public, open contribution

## Current Configuration

**Julia the Viper v0.1.0**: **Perimeter 3 (Community Sandbox)**

We are actively seeking founding maintainers and trusted contributors.

## Perimeter Definitions

### Perimeter 1: Core (Not Yet Established)

**Access**: Maintainers only
**Trust Level**: Highest
**Write Access**: Direct commit to `main` branch

**Components**:
- Release management
- Security advisories
- Cryptographic keys
- CI/CD secrets
- Domain and infrastructure

**Requirements to Enter**:
- 6+ months as Perimeter 2 contributor
- 50+ merged PRs with significant impact
- Demonstrated security awareness
- Unanimous approval from existing P1 maintainers
- Background discussion with existing team

**Responsibilities**:
- Code review for all PRs
- Security vulnerability triage
- Release creation and signing
- Infrastructure management
- Conflict resolution

### Perimeter 2: Trusted Contributors (Not Yet Established)

**Access**: Trusted contributors
**Trust Level**: Moderate
**Write Access**: Can approve PRs, cannot merge to `main` without review

**Components**:
- Feature development
- Bug fixes
- Documentation improvements
- Test additions
- Example programs

**Requirements to Enter**:
- 3+ months active contribution
- 10+ merged PRs
- Positive code review history
- Demonstrated understanding of project values
- Nomination by P1 maintainer
- Simple majority approval from P1

**Responsibilities**:
- Review community PRs
- Triage issues
- Mentor new contributors
- Maintain component quality
- Attend monthly syncs (optional)

### Perimeter 3: Community Sandbox (CURRENT)

**Access**: Anyone
**Trust Level**: Minimal (trust but verify)
**Write Access**: Fork and PR workflow

**Components**:
- All public repositories
- Documentation suggestions
- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Community discussions

**Requirements to Enter**:
- GitHub account
- Agree to Code of Conduct
- Read CONTRIBUTING.md

**Responsibilities**:
- Follow Code of Conduct
- Provide constructive feedback
- Test and report bugs
- Suggest improvements
- Help other community members

## Security Boundaries

### P1 ↔ P2 Boundary

**Controls**:
- P2 cannot merge without P1 review
- P2 cannot access secrets or signing keys
- P2 cannot create releases
- P2 PRs require 2 approvals (1 from P1)

**Rationale**: Prevents insider threats while enabling scaling

### P2 ↔ P3 Boundary

**Controls**:
- P3 cannot push directly to repository
- P3 PRs require 1 approval from P2 or P1
- P3 cannot trigger sensitive CI/CD jobs
- P3 cannot access private discussions

**Rationale**: Prevents supply chain attacks while encouraging contribution

## Trust Escalation Process

### P3 → P2 (Community → Trusted)

1. **Self-Nomination** or **P1/P2 Nomination**
2. **Evidence**: Link to 10+ quality PRs
3. **Interview**: 30-minute video call with P1 maintainer
4. **Vote**: Simple majority of P1 maintainers
5. **Announcement**: Public recognition
6. **Access**: Added to `trusted-contributors` team
7. **Onboarding**: 2-week mentorship

**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks from nomination to decision

### P2 → P1 (Trusted → Core)

1. **Nomination**: Must be from existing P1 maintainer
2. **Evidence**: 50+ quality PRs, 6+ months P2 tenure
3. **Background**: Private discussion of long-term commitment
4. **Vote**: Unanimous approval required
5. **Announcement**: Public recognition
6. **Access**: Added to `maintainers` team, granted signing keys
7. **Onboarding**: 1-month mentorship

**Timeline**: 1-2 months from nomination to decision

## De-Escalation Process

### Inactive Contributors

- **P2 Inactive**: No activity for 6 months → moved to P3
- **P1 Inactive**: No activity for 12 months → moved to emeritus
- **Re-activation**: Can re-apply with simplified process

### Code of Conduct Violations

- **Minor**: Warning, temporary P3-only access
- **Moderate**: Suspension from P2/P1, moved to P3
- **Severe**: Permanent ban from all perimeters

See CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md for details.

## Component Mapping

### Perimeter 1 Components

- `main` branch (protected)
- Release tags (signed)
- Security advisories (private)
- CI/CD secrets
- Domain DNS
- Package registry tokens (crates.io, npm)

### Perimeter 2 Components

- Feature branches
- Documentation PRs
- Test additions
- Example programs
- Issue triage
- Community support

### Perimeter 3 Components

- Forks (unrestricted)
- Issues (anyone can file)
- Discussions (anyone can participate)
- Wiki (anyone can suggest edits)
- Examples (CC0 license, public domain)

## Branch Protection

### `main` Branch (P1 Only)

- Require PR reviews: 2 (including 1 P1)
- Require status checks: All CI/CD must pass
- Require signed commits: Yes
- Enforce for administrators: Yes
- Restrict push: P1 only

### `develop` Branch (P2+)

- Require PR reviews: 1 (P2 or P1)
- Require status checks: All CI/CD must pass
- Require signed commits: Recommended
- Enforce for administrators: No

### Feature Branches (P3+)

- No restrictions
- Encourage atomic commits
- Encourage descriptive names

## CI/CD Security

### Secrets Access

- **P1**: Can create/modify secrets
- **P2**: Can view secret names (not values)
- **P3**: No secret access

### Job Triggers

- **P1**: Can trigger all jobs
- **P2**: Can trigger build/test jobs
- **P3**: PRs trigger limited subset (no deploy)

## Communication Channels

### Public (P3)

- GitHub Issues
- GitHub Discussions
- Public Discord (when available)

### Semi-Private (P2)

- Trusted contributors Discord
- Monthly sync calls
- Design docs review

### Private (P1)

- Maintainers email list
- Security discussions
- Infrastructure access

## Incident Response

### Security Vulnerability (P1 + External Researcher)

1. **Report**: Private security advisory
2. **Triage**: P1 maintainers review (24-48 hours)
3. **Fix**: P1 maintainers develop patch
4. **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure (see SECURITY.md)

### Compromise of P2/P1 Account

1. **Detection**: Unusual activity alerts
2. **Immediate**: Revoke access, invalidate tokens
3. **Investigation**: Review all recent changes
4. **Communication**: Private notification to team
5. **Resolution**: Re-verify identity, restore access if appropriate

## Metrics & Monitoring

We track:

- **P3 → P2 conversion rate**: Target 5% of active contributors
- **P2 → P1 conversion rate**: Target 10% of P2 after 1 year
- **Average time in P3**: Track contributor journey
- **PR review latency**: P2/P1 responsiveness

## Future Evolution

As the project matures:

- **P1 Growth**: Target 3-5 core maintainers
- **P2 Growth**: Target 10-15 trusted contributors
- **P3 Health**: Measure community engagement
