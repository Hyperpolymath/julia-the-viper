## Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

### Reporting Process

1. **Email**: Send details to security@julia-viper.dev (or open a private security advisory on GitHub)
2. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)
3. **Response Time**: We aim to respond within 48 hours
4. **Fix Timeline**: Critical issues will be patched within 7 days

### Security Guarantees

Julia the Viper provides the following **architectural security guarantees**:

#### 1. Code Injection is Grammatically Impossible

The parser enforces Harvard Architecture separation:
- **Data Language**: Only addition allowed, no control flow
- **Control Language**: Can use Data results, but Data cannot call Control

**Example Attack Prevention**:
```python
# In other languages, this could execute:
user_input = "5; import os; os.system('rm -rf /')"
eval(user_input)  # DISASTER!

# In JtV, this is a parse error:
user_value = malicious_input
result = user_value + 10  # Parser rejects non-numeric input
```

The grammar makes injection **impossible to express**, not just "hard to do".

#### 2. No Integer Overflow in Data Language

All arithmetic in Data expressions uses checked operations:
- Addition with overflow detection
- Bounded iteration counts
- Type-safe number system conversions

#### 3. No Reentrancy Attacks

Smart contract operations are atomic:
- State updates happen in single transaction
- No external calls during state modification
- Balance checks grammatically enforced

#### 4. Guaranteed Termination for Pure Functions

Functions marked `@pure` or `@total` are proven to halt:
- No unbounded loops allowed in pure context
- No recursion in Data Language
- Static analysis verifies termination

### Vulnerability Classes

#### Critical (Immediate Patch)
- Parser bypass allowing control flow in Data context
- Memory safety violation in Rust code
- Type confusion leading to arbitrary code execution

#### High (7-day Patch)
- Integer overflow in interpreter
- Incorrect totality analysis
- Smart contract state corruption

#### Medium (30-day Patch)
- Performance degradation attack (DoS)
- Error message information disclosure
- Incorrect optimization

#### Low (Next Release)
- Documentation inaccuracies
- Build system issues
- Non-critical deprecations

### Security Testing

We maintain:
- **Fuzzing**: Grammar fuzzing with AFL++
- **Property Testing**: QuickCheck-style tests for interpreter
- **Static Analysis**: Clippy with security lints
- **Formal Verification**: Lean 4 proofs for core properties (planned v2)

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow coordinated disclosure:
1. **Day 0**: Receive report
2. **Day 1-2**: Acknowledge and triage
3. **Day 3-7**: Develop fix
4. **Day 8**: Private disclosure to affected users
5. **Day 15**: Public disclosure with patch

### Security Hall of Fame

We recognize security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities:

- (No reports yet - be the first!)

### Security Contacts

- **Email**: security@julia-viper.dev
- **PGP Key**: [Coming soon]
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Preferred method

### Security-Related Configuration

#### Recommended Deployment

For smart contracts:
```toml
[security]
max_iterations = 1_000_000  # Prevent DoS
enable_trace = false        # Don't leak execution info in production
pure_function_enforcement = true  # Strict purity checking
```

For development:
```toml
[security]
max_iterations = 10_000_000
enable_trace = true
pure_function_enforcement = true
```

### Known Security Considerations

#### Type System (v1)
- Currently no type checking - planned for v1.1
- Runtime type errors possible
- Mitigation: Explicit type annotations

#### Module System (v1)
- Import resolution not fully implemented
- No namespace isolation yet
- Mitigation: Use single-file programs for now

#### WASM Backend (v1)
- Code generation incomplete
- No sandboxing yet
- Mitigation: Use interpreter for security-critical code

### Cryptographic Usage

JtV itself does not implement cryptography, but smart contracts may:

**DO**:
- Use established cryptographic libraries (libsodium, ring)
- Verify signatures before state changes
- Use constant-time operations

**DON'T**:
- Implement crypto in JtV itself (use FFI)
- Roll your own crypto
- Use weak algorithms (MD5, SHA1)

### Security Roadmap

- **v1.1**: Type checking to prevent type confusion
- **v1.2**: Module isolation for security boundaries
- **v2.0**: Formal verification with Lean 4
- **v2.1**: Certified compilation (CompCert-style)
